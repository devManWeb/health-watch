This script was created to avoid a sedentary life at the office. 

Based on the configured parameters and the current time, it shows when it's time to take a break.

The first time you open the script, you can configure the start and end time, whether it is a part-time job or not, when to take a lunch break and the duration of the break.

Important: the script is still in development, at the moment it does not work and must be tested. There are several TODOs and FIXMEs
